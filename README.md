# Contact Form Project

This is a simple contact form I made while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
The goal was to create a form where users can enter their **name, email and message** and it checks if everything is filled correctly before submitting.

## What it does
- Checks if the name, email, and message are not empty.
- Makes sure the email looks like a real email (example: test@gmail.com).
- Shows error messages if something is wrong.
- Shows a success message if everything is correct.

---

## What I used
- **HTML** → to build the form structure  
- **CSS** → just some basic styling so it looks neat  
- **JavaScript** → to add the validation and messages  

I tested it using **Google Chrome** and wrote the code in **VS Code**.

## How to try it
1. Download or copy the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Type some details and hit submit.  
   - If something is missing or wrong, it will show an error.  
   - If everything is fine, it will say the form is submitted successfully.

## What I learned
- How to make a basic form in HTML.
- How to use JavaScript for checking inputs (client-side validation).
- How to give feedback to the user (error and success messages).

This is a beginner-level project, but it helped me understand how forms actually work in real websites.
